## Overview

Bullet journaling organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook.

The core utilities of bullet journals are:
- an **index** (points to where information on different topics is located)
- **rapid logging** (using symbols to simplify, abbreviate and organize information)
- **logs** (to-do lists)
- **collections** (organizing information by content)

Our product, Toki Journal, took these core features and developed an application for students focused around the theme of personalization. Further details on the features and functionality of our product can be found in the End User Documentation linked right above.
