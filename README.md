# CSE 110 Group 24 - Bullet Journal Project

[Team Page](./admin/team.md)

Bullet journaling organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook.

The core utilities of bullet journals are:
- an **index** (points to where information on different topics is located)
- **rapid logging** (using symbols to simplify, abbreviate and organize information)
- **logs** (to-do lists)
- **collections** (organizing information by content)
- **migration** (periodically updating lists to new lists)
