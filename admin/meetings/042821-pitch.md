**Members Present**: Aneesha, Vardhan, Shane, Prashanth, Nicholas, Younghyun, Ly, Emma

**Members Absent**: None

**Agenda**:
- Complete user personas
- Complete low fidelity wireframes
- Start putting together a starting pitch doc

**Decisions**:
- Focus on students as the main target users of the bullet journal
    - *Reasoning*: Students are a large demographic that have a lot of assignments and events to keep track of which would make bullet journaling very useful for them. Additionally, as fellow students it will be easier to empathize with them as users and understand the main pain points.

**Action Items**:
- Fill out when2meet to figure out when to work on high fidelity wireframes this week (by Wed 4/28)
