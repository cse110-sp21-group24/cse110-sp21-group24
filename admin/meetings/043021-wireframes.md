# Good Mighty Engineers (24) - Wireframe Design Meeting 4/30/2021

### Meeting held over Zoom at 10:00AM

**Members Present**: Aneesha, Vardhan, Shane, Prashanth, Nicholas, Younghyun, Ly, Emma

**Members Absent**: None

**Agenda**:
- Complete high fidelity wireframes

**Decisions**:
- The color theme of the bullet journal will be shades of blue and green
    - *Reasoning*: Dealing with task management can be overwhelming (especially for students) and blue is known to have a calming effect. Additionally, reflection and mindfulness are components of the philosphy of bullet journaling, and these ideas are often represented with cool toned colors like blue.
- Remove "Goals" page
    - *Reasoning*: There is no weekly log in the general bullet journal design, and monthly and daily logs are easily accessible so having a separate goals page is not necessary.
- Include separate home page
    - *Reasoning*: Including a landing page that features the cover of a journal makes the experience more personal and like the user is actually writing in a journal.

**Action Items**:
- Complete rest of pitch asynchronously (by Mon 5/3)

### Meeting finished at 1:00PM
