**Members Absent**: None

**Agenda**:
- Complete high fidelity wireframes
- Complete starting pitch
- Go to professor's OH to receive feedback on wireframes

**OH Notes**:
- Consider having in place editing for tasks rather than a dialog box to reduce friction
    - Important to consider how content is captured
- Think about adding personalization elements

**Group Meeting Notes**:
- In order to add customization, can implement feature that extracts colors from image and creates a custom color palette for the journal
	- Use to make more personal
	- Ex. logo of school or sports team

**Decisions**:
- Remove dialog box, instead allow for in place editing
    - *Reasoning*: It will be less effort and faster for the user to simply be able to directly edit a line rather than having to navigate through different windows and buttons.

**Action Items**:
- Fill out when2meet for this week's availability (by Mon 5/3)
