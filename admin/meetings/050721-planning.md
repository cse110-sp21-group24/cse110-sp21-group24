# Good Mighty Engineers (24) - Sprint Planning Meeting 5/8/2021

### Meeting held over Zoom at 11:00AM

**Members Present**: Aneesha, Vardhan, Shane, Prashanth, Younghyun, Ly, Emma

**Members Absent**: Nicholas

**Agenda**:
- Decide whether or not we want to continue with the new designs
- Plan sprints and assign specific tasks for the first sprint
    - Located at specs/timeline

**Decisions**:
- Continue with new design
    - *Reasoning*: We want our unique take on the bullet journal project to be the emphasis on customization and personalization. The old design is too minimalistic for this goal.
- Leave the automatic migration feature as an additional feature that will only be implemented if time permits.
    - *Reasoning*: Migration can be done fairly easily manually, so having this feature is not essential to our bullet journal.

**Action Items**:
- Finish new high fidelity designs (by Mon 5/10)
- Create GitHub issues for first sprint tasks (by Mon 5/10)

### Meeting finished at 12:00PM
