*CI/CD Pipeline*:
- Have not made as much progress as we would have liked on it, need to add actions for JSDocs, Jest, and ESLint
- **Action Item**: Try to finish most of it today, and update at the general meeting tomorrow
- **Action Item**: Ask Deepak for more details about what the testing will look like

*JS is hard*:
- Will continue to keep a open line of communication within the team to support each other
- Ask mentors for resources if stuck

*Overwhelming amount of stuff left to do*:
- Based on other team projects from Deepak's teams, we're going at a similar pace, so likely at a good spot
- **Action Item**: Group similar tasks (like task editing) so that there are fewer redundancies and project development can be more efficient

*Other*:
- **Action Item**: Ask Deepak about storing information in Firebase vs other options
- Generally, lots of good comments
    - Postive feedback on the team dynamic, the work we have accomplished so far, and communication
