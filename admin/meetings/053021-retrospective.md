*#1 Local Storage*:
- It is hard to store everything as a string, and storing bullets and stickers is hard  
- Tricky to store entries, since it would be easier to store them as objects  
- **Action Item**: Do more research on local storage and as Deepak for advice

*#2 Bugs and Uncertainty*:
- Bullet alignment on weekly log
- Code coverage on puppeteer
- Local storage
- Generating dates
- Overall, good progress though, and week 10 is a good time to be fixing these bugs

*#3 Week 10*:
- :'(
- We likely won't have enough time to really polish the website, but the core functionality should be there

*Other*:
- Generally, lots of good comments
    - Postive feedback on the team dynamic, the work we have accomplished so far, and communication
