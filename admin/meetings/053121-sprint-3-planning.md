**Notes**:  
*TASK DISTRIBUTION (Week 10)*:  
*Prashanth* → Local storage for logs and polishing daily logs  
*Younghyun* → Polish custom list -- adding bullet functionality and adding local storage  
*Vardhan* → Calendar page, helping with daily logs  
*Aneesha* → Testing, index page  
*Emma* → Future log storage  
*Nicholas* → Working on local storage  
*Ly* → Saving entries with local storage, color scheme bug fix

**Decisions**:  
- Remove previous and next buttons
  - *Reasoning*: There are multiple other ways of navigating through pages, so having this additional method doesn't make sense
- Try to complete all tasks by midnight on Sunday, with next Wednesday as a hard deadline
  - *Reasoning*: We want to make sure we have enough time to make a polished video for the final

**Action Items**:  
- Ask Deepak about using local storage and test coverage (by Mon 5/31)
