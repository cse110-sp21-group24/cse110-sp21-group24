# Change design goal to focus on personalization

* Date: 05/07/21

## Context and Problem Statement
Our original design was fairly simplistic and lacked any unique features. How should the bullet journal be re-designed to provide unique features to the users and stand out from the other bullet journals?

## Considered Options
* Productivity centered application (very basic features, no customization)
* Highly customizable application (ex. Stickers, themes, fonts, etc.)

## Decision Outcome
* Chosen: Highly customizable application

## Positive Consequences
* Adding a focus on personalization to the design would allow users to enjoy the customization aspect of a physical bullet journal. 
* Additionally, it would be better suited to our target users because customization features are often very important to students who enjoy adding a personal touch to how their journal looks. 
* Makes our bullet journal unique by bringing physical features into a digital bullet journal

## Negative Consequences
* Adding so many customizable features could be difficult to implement given our time constraints and level of expertise with using JavaScript/HTML/CSS
