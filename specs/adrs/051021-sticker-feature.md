# Adding sticker and washi tapes interaction

* Date: 05/10/21

## Context and Problem Statement
One of our customization features is allowing users to add stickers and washi tapes on the pages. How should users be able to add stickers and washi tapes on each of the pages?

## Considered Options
* Fixed sticker/washi tapes placement that user can toggle and change
* Button that brings up the stickers and washi tapes options so users can drag and drop it

## Decision Outcome
* Chosen: Button that brings up the stickers and washi tapes options so users can drag and drop it

## Positive Consequences
* Allows for dragging and dropping so users can place it anywhere they want instead of a fixed placement (more creative freedom)
* One place where all the options are shown so users don't have to click a lot to toggle through the options

## Negative Consequences
* May be hard to implement code-wise
* Need to research on drag and drop functionality
