# Host website with firebase

* Date: 05/12/21

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to choose a method to deploy our website, and want to choose the one that will best support our app design.

## Considered Options
* Firebase
* GitHub Pages
* Heroku

## Decision Outcome
* Chosen: Firebase

## Positive Consequences
* There is a lot of documentation and resources associated with Firebase, which will make resolving any bugs or issues related to it easier.
* Since there is a storage element that could be used with a Firebase, this will help us keep our options open as we have not yet decided on how to store user information.

## Negative Consequences
* This could potentially add unnecessary complexity to the build process.
